- **🎨 Drawing Reconciliation:** Revisiting and refining visual representations to improve clarity, accuracy, and relevance, ensuring visuals are aligned with evolving ideas and insights.
- **🎨 Sketchnoting:** Capturing ideas and information in real-time by combining words and visuals, creating a structured and engaging summary of complex topics or conversations.
- **🎨 Experimental Drawing:** Exploring unconventional or abstract ways of drawing to encourage creative expression, idea exploration, and visual problem-solving outside traditional frameworks.
- **🎨 Active Listening:** Paying close attention to spoken information and converting it into visual notes and symbols, enhancing understanding and retention of key ideas.
- **🎨 Visual Synthesis:** Condensing complex information into a simplified, cohesive visual form that emphasizes essential elements and connections, helping audiences quickly grasp the main points.
- **🎨 Personal Iconography:** Developing a unique set of symbols and icons that represent common themes or concepts, creating a personal “visual dictionary” for more effective and consistent communication.
- **🎨 Human Data Visualization:** Representing data in ways that are not only accurate but also human-centered and relatable, making data insights accessible and engaging for diverse audiences.
- **🎨 Graphic Recording:** Creating real-time visual notes during live events or presentations, capturing the flow and highlights of discussions in a way that preserves and enhances the original content.
- **🎨 Visual Collaboration:** Using visuals to facilitate teamwork, ideation, and problem-solving among team members, creating shared understanding and alignment through diagrams, sketches, and flowcharts.
- **🎨 Visual Structures:** Organizing information into structured layouts, such as grids, hierarchies, and mind maps, to clarify relationships and create visually coherent frameworks.

## Why is it worth learning Visual Thinking as a developer? 💻

- **🖍️ Enhanced Problem Solving:** Visual Thinking helps decompose complex problems into simpler, more manageable visual representations, making it easier to understand and approach technical challenges.
- **🖍️ Improved Code Comprehension:** Visualizing code structures, data flows, and dependencies can clarify relationships and functions within a codebase, especially in systems with many interdependent components.
- **🖍️ Better Communication with Teams:** Drawing and visual explanations facilitate clearer communication among team members, making it easier to convey design decisions, bug solutions, or code review feedback.
- **🖍️ Faster Onboarding:** Visual aids can make onboarding new team members more efficient, as diagrams and sketches provide context and clarity that speed up understanding of project architecture and workflows.
- **🖍️ Efficient Debugging and Refactoring:** Sketching data flows or process interactions helps in spotting potential bottlenecks, bugs, and refactoring opportunities that may not be obvious through code alone.
- **🖍️ Enhanced Cognitive Processing:** Visual Thinking engages spatial and visual parts of the brain, promoting better retention and understanding of complex information, especially when learning new concepts or languages.
- **🖍️ Tool for Creativity and Innovation:** Visual Thinking encourages out-of-the-box thinking, enabling developers to creatively brainstorm new features, optimize existing systems, and explore alternative solutions.
- **🖍️ Documentation that Speaks for Itself:** Visual Thinking can make technical documentation more engaging and accessible, allowing for quick reference diagrams that are often more intuitive than text descriptions alone.
- **🖍️ User-Centered Perspective:** Drawing out user flows, interfaces, and experience journeys helps developers think from the user’s perspective, leading to more user-friendly design choices.
- **🖍️ Better Planning and Architecture Design:** Visuals are essential when planning new features or system architectures, allowing you to explore design options before committing to code.

This are some ideas about where to apply **Visual Thinking**:

- Sketch PRs with Your Own **Code Contributions** 
- Illustrate PRs from Others to **Give Better Feedback**
- Create **Notations for Flows** (Code Release, CI/CD, Environments, Team Practices, Company Flows)
- Illustrate **Technical Concepts** Alongside Other Diagrams
- Create Simple **Summaries for Frameworks**
- Create Visual Notes as a **Diary for Personal Feedback**
- Help Create Visual Summaries to Keep **Business Logic Fresh Across Teams**

I developer a short **visual thinking introduction workshop** for developers: https://github.com/visualpartnership/visual-thinking-workshop 🚀

And also you can check some trainings I made: https://github.com/visualpartnership/visualthinking?tab=readme-ov-file

If you start to make exercises, don't hesiate to open a ISSUE with your visuals, so I'll have the opportunity to give you feedback.
